## Project Structure

The project consists of the following sheets in the Excel workbook:

- **Data Sheet:** Contains the cleaned and processed data after performing data cleaning, merging, and transformations using Power Query. The raw data, originally in three separate sheets, has been consolidated and enriched with new columns for analysis purposes.

- **Analysis Sheet:** Contains pivot tables that summarize and visualize key insights from the cleaned data. It presents correlations between employee attrition and various parameters, including salary hikes, performance ratings, department-wise attrition, and other relevant factors impacting attrition.

- **Dashboard Sheet:** Hosts the interactive dashboard with dynamic visualizations and slicers. The dashboard utilizes the cleaned data to present key findings and allow users to interactively explore the data.

## 🤔 Challenges Faced

- **Data Variety**: Handling diverse data types, including numerical, date-based, and categorical, posed data preprocessing challenges.

- **Data Volume**: Analyzing a large dataset required efficient memory management and processing techniques.

- **Data Quality**: Addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies was critical for accurate analysis.
